### Color Schemes

* Green is used as the main color throughout the site and in the background image on both pages. 
It was chosen because of a strong association with wildlife and nature, the main theme of the quiz.
* Orange is used on buttons to draw attention to them due to a strong contrast with green. 
* Background and foreground color combinations have been checked where possible to ensure they 
meet WCAG AA Color Contrast requirements. 
* Color contrast was checked using [Web AIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/). Not all combinations could be checked due to the background image.
